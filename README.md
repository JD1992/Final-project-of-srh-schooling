# Final project of SRH education
This is my final project of the 2-year education at the SRH Fachschule Stuttgart, where I got the title "Staatlich 
anerkannter Informatiker f√ºr Game und Multimedia Entwicklung".


It is mostly developed with PHP, JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Here are the technologies and a comment on what I used
 them for.
 
 * PHP
    * Dynamic sites construction like Wordpress. Parts that are no0t going to change are in separate files and loaded
     directly into the page. The main part of the page is dynamic and loaded specified by a parameter in the url. For
      the game PHP is loading the level, which are each in one file, saving the file content to a specific element in
       the main part, which the JavaScript then uses to produce the level
 * JavaScript
    * It is primarily used by the game itself and the progression site to display statistics in charts
* HTML and CSS
    * HTML is generally used for the page structure and the content. CSS is used for the styling
