# Final project of SRH education
This is my final project of the 2-year education at the SRH Fachschule Stuttgart, where I received the title "Staatlich 
anerkannter Informatiker f√ºr Game und Multimedia Entwicklung".


This project is mostly developed with PHP, JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Here are the technologies and a short
 explanation on what I used them for.
 
 * PHP
    * Used for dynamic site construction like Wordpress. Parts that are not going to change are in separate files and
     loaded directly into the page. The main part of the page is dynamic and loaded specified by a parameter in the
      url. For the game PHP is loading the level, which are each in one file, saving the file content to a specific
       element in the main part, which the JavaScript then uses to produce the level
 * JavaScript
    * It is primarily used by the game itself and the progression site to display statistics in charts
* HTML and CSS
    * HTML is generally used for the page structure and the content. CSS is used for the styling
